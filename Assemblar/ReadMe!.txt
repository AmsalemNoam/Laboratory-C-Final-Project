/* 
	Amsalem Noam Mmn14 Assembler Project


How to use:
	Use makefile to compile the project.
	After preparing assembly files with an .as extension, open terminal and pass file names as arguments (without the file endings).
	Make sure that the assembly files and the makefile are in the Cfiles folder.

Output:
	The assembler will generate output files with the same filenames and the following extensions:

	.ob - Object file
	.ent - Entries file
	.ext - Externals file
	
	The Entries and Externals files will be generated only if there are .entry or .extern is the assembly files



Unfortunately, there is a problem and the file does not work as intended and show wrong output in some places.
